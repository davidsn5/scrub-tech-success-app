    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Bone Nibbler\n(Double Action Rongeur)",
    explanation: "A bone nibbler (double action rongeur) is a powerful cutting instrument that uses a double-action mechanism to provide increased cutting force for removing bone and cartilage. The double-action design multiplies the force applied by the surgeon's hand, making it easier to cut through dense bone tissue. These instruments are particularly useful for spinal procedures, joint surgeries, and situations requiring removal of thick bone or calcified tissue.",

    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Periosteal Elevator\n(Periosteal Stripper)",
    explanation: "A periosteal elevator is a flat, curved instrument used for lifting and separating the periosteum (bone covering membrane) from the underlying bone surface. It features a smooth, curved blade that allows for gentle separation without tearing the periosteum. Available in various widths and curvatures, periosteal elevators are essential for exposing bone surfaces during fracture repairs, bone grafting procedures, and implant surgeries while preserving the vital periosteal blood supply.",
