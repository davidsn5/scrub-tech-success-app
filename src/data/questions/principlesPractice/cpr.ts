    question: "If you cannot ventilate through the mouth, you should attempt:",
    choices: ["No breaths", "Mouth-to-nose ventilation", "Continue compressions only", "Wait for physician"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "If mouth-to-mouth ventilation is not possible, mouth-to-nose ventilation should be attempted."
  },
  {
    id: 67,
    question: "During CPR, what should the rescuer avoid?",
    choices: ["Allowing full chest recoil", "Leaning on the chest between compressions", "Giving two breaths after 30 compressions", "Switching compressors every 2 minutes"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Leaning on the chest between compressions prevents full chest recoil and reduces cardiac output."
  },
  {
    id: 68,
    question: "Before applying defibrillator pads, what must be done?",
    choices: ["Remove jewelry and clothing", "Wait 10 minutes", "Stop CPR", "Place on lower abdomen"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Jewelry and clothing should be removed from the chest area before applying defibrillator pads for safety and effectiveness."
  },

    question: "Which of the following is NOT part of the Chain of Survival?",
    choices: ["Early recognition", "Early CPR", "Early defibrillation", "Immediate surgery"],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "The Chain of Survival includes early recognition, early CPR, early defibrillation, and advanced life support - not immediate surgery."

    question: "Which of the following is true about CPR?",
    choices: ["Ventilations are unnecessary", "Chest compressions only are as effective long-term", "Combining compressions and ventilations is better", "Defibrillation is unnecessary if CPR is started early"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Combining compressions and ventilations provides the best outcomes for cardiac arrest patients."

    question: "What is the appropriate response to agonal breathing in an unresponsive patient?",
    choices: ["Delay CPR", "Begin CPR immediately", "Wait for physician", "Provide oxygen only"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Agonal breathing in an unresponsive patient indicates cardiac arrest and requires immediate CPR."

    question: "Why is leaning on the chest between compressions bad practice?",
    choices: ["It allows recoil and perfusion", "It increases coronary perfusion", "It prevents chest recoil and perfusion", "It improves CPR quality"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
