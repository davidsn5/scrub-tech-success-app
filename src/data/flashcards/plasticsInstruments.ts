  {
    question: "What is the function of a dermatome in plastic surgery?",
    answer: "Harvesting skin grafts of uniform thickness",
    explanation: "Dermatomes are specialized instruments that cut thin, uniform layers of skin for grafting procedures, ensuring consistent graft thickness for optimal healing."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of forceps is best for handling fat grafts?",
    answer: "Smooth forceps or specialized fat handling forceps",
    explanation: "Smooth, atraumatic forceps prevent damage to delicate fat cells during transfer procedures, maintaining cell viability for successful fat grafting."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a Brown-Adson forceps?",
    answer: "Grasping skin and superficial tissues",
    explanation: "Brown-Adson forceps have fine teeth that provide secure grip on skin and superficial tissues while minimizing trauma, commonly used in plastic surgery procedures."
  },
  {
    question: "What instrument is used for liposuction procedures?",
    answer: "Liposuction cannula",
    explanation: "Liposuction cannulas are hollow tubes with side ports that suction out fat cells while the surgeon manipulates the cannula to contour the treated area."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the function of a tissue expander?",
    answer: "Gradually stretching skin to create extra tissue",
    explanation: "Tissue expanders are inflatable devices placed under the skin that are gradually filled with saline to stretch the overlying skin, creating additional tissue for reconstruction."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of scissors is used for fine dissection around nerves?",
    answer: "Metzenbaum scissors or tenotomy scissors",
    explanation: "These fine-tipped scissors allow for precise dissection around delicate structures like nerves and blood vessels without causing damage to surrounding tissues."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a mammotome in breast surgery?",
    answer: "Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy",
    explanation: "A mammotome uses vacuum suction and a rotating cutting device to obtain multiple tissue samples through a single insertion, minimizing scarring and patient discomfort."
  },
  {
    question: "What instrument is used for measuring tissue thickness?",
    answer: "Tissue thickness gauge or caliper",
    explanation: "These instruments provide precise measurements of tissue thickness, crucial for planning reconstructive procedures and ensuring proper graft sizing."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the function of microsurgical forceps?",
    answer: "Handling very small vessels and nerves during microsurgery",
    explanation: "Microsurgical forceps are extremely fine instruments designed for manipulating tiny structures like blood vessels and nerves during reconstructive microsurgery."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of retractor is commonly used in breast augmentation?",
    answer: "Finochietto retractor or breast retractor",
    explanation: "These retractors provide optimal exposure of the surgical field while protecting surrounding tissues during breast enhancement procedures."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a harmonic scalpel in plastic surgery?",
    answer: "Cutting and coagulating tissue simultaneously",
    explanation: "Harmonic scalpels use ultrasonic energy to cut and seal blood vessels simultaneously, reducing bleeding and thermal damage to surrounding tissues."
  },
  {
    question: "What instrument is used for tattooing surgical markings?",
    answer: "Surgical marking pen or gentian violet",
    explanation: "These sterile marking instruments allow surgeons to draw precise surgical plans on the skin that remain visible throughout the procedure."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the function of a mesh inserter in breast reconstruction?",
    answer: "Placing surgical mesh for tissue support",
    explanation: "Mesh inserters facilitate the precise placement of surgical mesh to provide support and coverage in reconstructive procedures, particularly in breast reconstruction."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of suture is preferred for facial plastic surgery?",
    answer: "Fine monofilament non-absorbable sutures",
    explanation: "Fine sutures like 6-0 or 7-0 nylon or polypropylene provide precise closure with minimal scarring, ideal for cosmetic facial procedures."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a tumescent solution in liposuction?",
