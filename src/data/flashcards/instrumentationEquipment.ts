    question: "Identify this surgical instrument",
    answer: "Kelly Clamp\n(Hemostat)",
    explanation: "The Kelly clamp is a curved hemostat typically 5.5-6.25 inches (14-16 cm) in length, featuring distinctive half serrations on the jaws. The half serrations extend only partway along the jaw length, with the tips remaining smooth for delicate tissue handling. This design provides secure clamping of blood vessels while minimizing tissue trauma. Kelly clamps have ring handles with a ratcheting mechanism and are available in both straight and curved varieties. They are essential instruments for controlling bleeding from medium-sized vessels and for general tissue manipulation during surgical procedures.",

    question: "Identify this surgical instrument",
    answer: "Singley Forceps\n(Tissue Forceps)",
    explanation: "Singley forceps are delicate tissue forceps typically 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) in length with long, slender jaws and smooth tips. These forceps are designed for precise handling of delicate tissues without causing trauma. The smooth, non-toothed jaws provide gentle grasping capability while the elongated design allows access to deep surgical sites. Singley forceps are commonly used in plastic surgery, microsurgery, and other procedures requiring careful tissue manipulation. The instrument features finger ring handles for precise control and is essential for suturing and handling of fragile anatomical structures.",

    question: "Identify this surgical instrument",
    answer: "Parker Retractor\n(Hand-held Retractor)",
    explanation: "The Parker retractor is a simple, curved hand-held retractor typically 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) in length with smooth, rounded ends. These retractors feature a gentle curve that allows for effective tissue retraction while minimizing trauma to delicate structures. Parker retractors are commonly used in various surgical procedures to hold tissues away from the operative field, providing clear visualization for the surgeon. The smooth surface prevents tissue snagging and the ergonomic design allows for comfortable handling during extended procedures. They are particularly useful in superficial surgeries and procedures requiring gentle tissue manipulation.",

    question: "Identify this surgical instrument",
    answer: "Hasson S-Shaped Retractor\n(Curved Hand-held Retractor)",
    explanation: "The Hasson S-shaped retractor is a specialized hand-held retractor featuring a distinctive S-curve design that provides superior tissue retraction capabilities. These retractors are typically 8-10 inches (20-25 cm) in length with smooth, curved ends that conform to anatomical contours. The S-shaped configuration allows for effective retraction of tissues at multiple angles and depths, making them particularly useful in laparoscopic and minimally invasive procedures. Named after Dr. Harrith Hasson, these retractors provide excellent visualization while minimizing tissue trauma and are commonly used in abdominal and pelvic surgeries.",

    question: "Identify this surgical instrument",
    answer: "Bookwalter Retractor\n(Self-Retaining Retractor System)",
    explanation: "The Bookwalter retractor is a sophisticated self-retaining retractor system designed for major abdominal and thoracic surgeries. This system consists of a central ring that attaches to the operating table and multiple interchangeable retractor blades that can be positioned at various angles and depths. The system provides 360-degree retraction capability, allowing surgeons to maintain optimal exposure throughout lengthy procedures without requiring manual retraction. Bookwalter retractors are particularly valuable in complex abdominal surgeries, including bowel resections, major vascular procedures, and organ transplants, where consistent, reliable retraction is essential for surgical success.",

    question: "Identify this surgical instrument",
    answer: "Balfour Retractor\n(Self-Retaining Abdominal Retractor)",
    explanation: "The Balfour retractor is a self-retaining retractor specifically designed for abdominal surgeries. It features a central frame with adjustable lateral blades that can be positioned to provide optimal exposure of the operative field. The retractor typically includes deep and shallow blade options to accommodate different tissue depths and surgical approaches. Balfour retractors are essential for procedures requiring prolonged abdominal exposure, such as bowel surgeries, appendectomies, and other intra-abdominal procedures. The self-retaining mechanism allows surgical team members to focus on the procedure rather than manual retraction, improving efficiency and reducing fatigue.",

    explanation: "The O'Sullivan O'Connor retractor is a specialized self-retaining retractor system designed primarily for gynecological and lower abdominal surgeries. This retractor features a circular or oval ring configuration with multiple adjustable blade attachments that provide circumferential retraction. The system is particularly effective for procedures requiring deep pelvic exposure, such as hysterectomies, cesarean sections, and other gynecological operations. The retractor's design allows for excellent visualization of deep anatomical structures while maintaining consistent retraction throughout the procedure. Named after its developers, this instrument has become a standard tool in obstetric and gynecological surgery.",

    question: "Identify this surgical instrument",
    answer: "Crilewood Needle Driver\n(Needle Holder)",
    explanation: "The Crilewood needle driver is a precision needle holder featuring tungsten carbide inserts in the jaws for superior grip and durability. These instruments are typically 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) in length with gold-colored finger rings for easy identification. The tungsten carbide inserts provide excellent needle control and prevent slippage during suturing, while also extending the instrument's lifespan. Crilewood needle drivers are designed with a locking mechanism that securely holds needles of various sizes and are commonly used in general surgery, plastic surgery, and other procedures requiring precise suturing. The ergonomic design reduces hand fatigue during extended suturing sessions.",
