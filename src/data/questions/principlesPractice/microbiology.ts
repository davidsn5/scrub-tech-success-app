    id: 6,
    question: "Which term describes a relationship where one organism benefits and the other is harmed?",
    choices: ["Mutualism", "Commensalism", "Parasitism", "Synergism"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Parasitism is defined as a relationship where the parasite benefits while the host is harmed."

    question: "Which of the following is NOT a portal of entry for microorganisms?",
    choices: ["Intact skin", "Respiratory tract", "Gastrointestinal tract", "Genitourinary tract"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Intact skin serves as a barrier to prevent microbial entry, while broken skin can be a portal of entry."
