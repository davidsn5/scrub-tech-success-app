    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Rake Retractor\n(Multi-Prong Retractor)",
    explanation: "A rake retractor is a multi-pronged retractor designed for retracting soft tissues and muscle during orthopedic procedures. It features multiple sharp prongs (typically 3-6) that provide secure tissue grip and excellent exposure of underlying bone structures. Available in various sizes and prong configurations, rake retractors are essential for maintaining clear surgical fields during joint procedures, fracture repairs, and spinal surgeries. The multiple contact points distribute pressure evenly while providing superior tissue control.",

    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Gelpi Retractor\n(Self-Retaining Retractor)",
    explanation: "The Gelpi retractor is a self-retaining retractor featuring two curved arms with sharp hooks and a spring-loaded ratcheting mechanism. This design allows the retractor to maintain constant tension and hold tissues apart without manual assistance. The sharp hooks provide secure grip on tissue edges, and the curved arms allow for excellent exposure of deeper structures. Gelpi retractors are commonly used in orthopedic surgery, spine surgery, and general surgery where sustained retraction of muscle and soft tissue is needed.",

    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Cobb Elevator\n(Periosteal Elevator)",
    explanation: "The Cobb elevator is a specialized periosteal elevator commonly used in spinal surgery and orthopedic procedures. It features a flat, curved blade designed for lifting and separating the periosteum from bone surfaces, particularly along the spine. The instrument allows for gentle separation of soft tissues from vertebrae and ribs while preserving vital structures. Cobb elevators are essential for creating surgical planes, exposing bone surfaces, and maintaining tissue integrity during spinal fusion and other orthopedic procedures.",

    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Wire Cutter\n(Orthopedic Wire Cutters)",
    explanation: "Orthopedic wire cutters are specialized cutting instruments designed for cutting surgical wires, pins, and small orthopedic hardware. They feature strong, sharp cutting jaws with leverage handles that provide powerful cutting force for metallic materials. Available in various sizes and jaw configurations, these cutters are essential for removing or trimming Kirschner wires, cerclage wires, and other orthopedic fixation devices. The precision cutting action prevents wire fragments and ensures clean cuts during hardware removal procedures.",

    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Weitlaner Retractor\n(Self-Retaining Retractor)",
    explanation: "The Weitlaner retractor is a self-retaining retractor featuring multiple sharp prongs or teeth on curved arms with a ratcheting mechanism. It maintains tension and holds tissues apart without manual assistance, making it ideal for superficial orthopedic procedures. The sharp teeth provide secure grip on tissue edges, and the self-retaining design frees the surgeon's hands for other tasks. Commonly used in plastic surgery, orthopedic procedures, and general surgery for maintaining exposure of shallow surgical sites.",

    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Hohmann Retractor\n(Bone Lever)",
    explanation: "The Hohmann retractor is a specialized orthopedic retractor featuring a curved or angled blade designed for retracting muscles and soft tissues away from bone surfaces. Available in various angles and blade widths, these retractors provide excellent exposure of bony structures during hip, knee, and other joint surgeries. The smooth, curved design allows for atraumatic tissue retraction while maintaining clear visualization of the operative field. Essential for joint replacement and fracture repair procedures, providing superior bone exposure.",

    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Pituitary Rongeur\n(Neurosurgical Rongeur)",
    explanation: "A pituitary rongeur is a specialized rongeur with an elongated shaft and small, delicate cutting jaws designed for removing tissue in confined spaces, particularly during neurosurgical and endoscopic procedures. The long, angled design allows access to deep surgical sites through small openings, such as during transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. The small, precise cutting jaws enable removal of soft tissue and small bone fragments with minimal trauma to surrounding structures. Essential for procedures requiring delicate tissue removal in narrow surgical corridors.",

    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Ruskin Rongeur\n(Bone Cutting Forceps)",
    explanation: "The Ruskin rongeur is a specialized bone-cutting instrument featuring curved, spring-loaded handles and sharp cutting jaws designed for removing bone and cartilage with precision. The curved design allows for excellent access to bone surfaces while the spring-loaded mechanism provides consistent cutting force. Commonly used in spinal procedures, joint surgeries, and trauma cases where controlled bone removal is required. The sharp cutting edges and ergonomic design make it ideal for shaping bone edges and removing bone spurs during orthopedic procedures.",

    question: "Identify this orthopedic surgical instrument",
    answer: "Duck Bill Rongeur\n(Duck Billed Rongeur)",
    explanation: "The Duck Bill Rongeur is a specialized bone-cutting instrument featuring curved jaws that resemble a duck's bill, designed for cutting and removing bone and cartilage in confined spaces. The unique curved design allows for precise bone removal in areas with limited access, particularly useful in spinal procedures and joint surgeries. The serrated cutting edges provide excellent grip on bone tissue while the curved shape enables surgeons to work around corners and in deep surgical sites. Essential for laminectomies, discectomies, and other procedures requiring precise bone removal.",
