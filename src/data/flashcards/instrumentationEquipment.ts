    answer: "Lorna Towel Clamp\n(Non-Perforating)",
    explanation: "The Lorna Towel Clamp is a non-perforating clamp typically 5.5 inches (14 cm) in length.

    question: "Identify this surgical instrument",
    answer: "Halstead Mosquito\n(Hemostat)",
    explanation: "The Halstead Mosquito is a small hemostat typically 5 inches (12.5 cm) in length. It features fine, delicate jaws with transverse serrations for clamping small blood vessels and controlling minor bleeding. The mosquito hemostat is ideal for precise hemostasis in superficial tissues and fine dissection work.",

    answer: "Mixter Right Angle\n(Hemostat)",
    explanation: "The Mixter Right Angle hemostat is a curved surgical clamp typically 7-9 inches (18-23 cm) in length. It features a distinctive right-angle curve near the tip with serrated jaws for secure clamping. This instrument is specifically designed for clamping blood vessels and tissues in hard-to-reach areas, particularly around curved anatomical structures. The right-angle design allows surgeons to access vessels behind organs or in deep surgical sites where straight instruments would be ineffective.",

    explanation: "The Curved Crile hemostat is a medium-sized surgical clamp typically 5.5-6.25 inches (14-16 cm) in length. It features a curved tip with transverse serrations for secure clamping of blood vessels and tissue. The curved design allows for better access around anatomical structures and improved visualization during surgical procedures. Crile hemostats are commonly used for controlling bleeding from medium-sized vessels and for general tissue manipulation during surgery.",
